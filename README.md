# TCP-Chat-room
Simple Chat room built using network and socket programming on Python. Need to add references :upside_down_face:

Bugs to be fixed:

Client disconnect exception on server side.  An exception occurs on the server side when the client disconnects using exit(). Any help is greatly appreciated :smiling:
